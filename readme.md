# CRUD CLUBES

#### Objective

Create an application that allows the user to _*create, read, update*_ and _*delete*_ information from a database.

#### About the app

The _***backend***_ consists in a **REST API**, which has been created using _*NODE*_ and _*ExpressJS*_, and a **JSON document** that works as a _*database*_.

We can find the application in the _*src*_ folder, where each layer of the app is separated in their own folders.

_*ZOD*_ is used to validate the provided information and the test code is being written using _*JEST*_

The **_*frontend*_** app is a _*React*_ project created in a _*Vite*_ enviroment. It has been styled using _*Tailwind*_ and components from _*Material UI*_.

The frontend allows the user to correctly manage the REST API, with clear and simply UI/UX.
